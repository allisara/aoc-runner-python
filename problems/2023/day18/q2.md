## \--- Part Two ---

The Elves were right to be concerned; the planned lagoon would be _much too small_.

After a few minutes, someone realizes what happened; someone _swapped the color and instruction parameters_ when producing the dig plan. They don't have time to fix the bug; one of them asks if you can _extract the correct instructions_ from the hexadecimal codes.

Each hexadecimal code is _six hexadecimal digits_ long. The first five hexadecimal digits encode the _distance in meters_ as a five-digit hexadecimal number. The last hexadecimal digit encodes the _direction to dig_: `0` means `R`, `1` means `D`, `2` means `L`, and `3` means `U`.

So, in the above example, the hexadecimal codes can be converted into the true instructions:

* `#70c710` \= `R 461937`
* `#0dc571` \= `D 56407`
* `#5713f0` \= `R 356671`
* `#d2c081` \= `D 863240`
* `#59c680` \= `R 367720`
* `#411b91` \= `D 266681`
* `#8ceee2` \= `L 577262`
* `#caa173` \= `U 829975`
* `#1b58a2` \= `L 112010`
* `#caa171` \= `D 829975`
* `#7807d2` \= `L 491645`
* `#a77fa3` \= `U 686074`
* `#015232` \= `L 5411`
* `#7a21e3` \= `U 500254`

Digging out this loop and its interior produces a lagoon that can hold an impressive `_952408144115_` cubic meters of lava.

Convert the hexadecimal color codes into the correct instructions; if the Elves follow this new dig plan, _how many cubic meters of lava could the lagoon hold?_
