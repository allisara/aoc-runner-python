## \--- Part Two ---

The galaxies are much _older_ (and thus much _farther apart_) than the researcher initially estimated.

Now, instead of the expansion you did before, make each empty row or column _one million times_ larger. That is, each empty row should be replaced with `1000000` empty rows, and each empty column should be replaced with `1000000` empty columns.

(In the example above, if each empty row or column were merely `10` times larger, the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be `_1030_`. If each empty row or column were merely `100` times larger, the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be `_8410_`. However, your universe will need to expand far beyond these values.)

Starting with the same initial image, expand the universe according to these new rules, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies. _What is the sum of these lengths?_
